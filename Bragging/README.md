CBEffects Bragging and Bragging Rights Info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Included in this folder are a number of CBEffects logos. If you just love CBEffects, you're welcome to put them somewhere in your app/game and/or write text credits to me or CBEffects.

Notice: With version 2.0, a new theme was introduced. If you have already included a PNG logo as credits, please change to the new set.

If you decide to add me or CBEffects in the credits, please adhere to these guidelines:

- When referring to me, please call me "Caleb P", "C. Place", or (preferably) "Gymbyl Coding".
- If an average eleven-year-old in an average *Christian* family wouldn't be allowed to play/use your app or game, **please** don't credit or mention me or any product of mine in it
- Links to my website are appreciated - www.gymbyl.com (some CBEffects logos have my website address on it, that's great too)
- Also acceptable is simply adding one (or more) of the logos instead of text (although adding both isn't objected to!)
- Please do not imply or convey in any form that I am in any way affiliated with you, your company, or your project; in other words, just keep things clear on who's who

Thanks!
