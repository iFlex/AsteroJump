CBEffects Parameter Reference
********************************************************************************
This is the overwhelmingly large containing all of the parameters you can possibly put in a Data Table for CBEffects.

You can use this as a reference for parameters or to get to sleep at night - whichever you find it most useful for. Unless you're looking for a certain parameter, this won't be a very interesting read.

“linearDamping”
Type: Number
Description: How the velocity of the particle changes. Positive values decay the velocity, negative values grow it.


“velocity”
Type: Number
Description: How fast the particle moves.


“angularVelocity”
Type: Number
Description: How fast the particle rotates.


“angularDamping”
Type: Number
Description: How the angular velocity of the particle changes. Positive values decay the angular velocity, negative values grow it.


“velFunction”
Type: Function
Description: Returns X and Y velocity for a particle on creation.


“useFunction”
Type: Boolean
Description: Whether to use the velFunction to set velocity (true) or to use the pre-defined angles to set velocity (false).


“autoAngle”
Type: Boolean 
Description: Whether the values in the angle table are single numbers or auto-fill tables.


“angles”
Type: Table
Description: Contains the angles for particles to travel at. 0 is pointing right, and it goes counter-clockwise around - in other words, 90 is straight up, 180 is left, etc. If autoAngle = true then it includes angle high and low bounds, low to high.


"iterateAngle"
Type: Boolean
Description: Whether to go through the angle table one by one or pick randomly from it.


"curAngle"
Type: Number
Description: The angle to start with if iterateAngle = true.


"angleIncr"
Type: Number
Description: The increment by which the current angle will be changed. Wraps to the number of available angles.


"preCalculate"
Type: Boolean
Description: Whether CBEffects calculates the forces needed for the angles beforehand or not. If set to false, each time a particle is created it performs an equation to see the X and Y velocity it needs to travel in an angle, using more memory - only set it to false if you're going to be changing the vent's velocity and/or angles after creating it.


“sizeX” and “sizeY”
Types: Numbers
Descriptions: How fast the particles grow X and Y scale. Negative values shrink particles.


“minX”, “minY”, “maxX”, “maxY”
Types: Numbers
Descriptions: The minimum and maximum X and Y scale the particles can grow or shrink to.


“gravityX” and “gravityY”
Types: Numbers
Descriptions: The X- and Y-gravity of the vent.


"divisionDamping"
Type: Boolean
Description: Whether ParticlePhysics divides velocity by damping or subtracts damping from velocity.
Note: When set to the boolean value of "true", set linearDamping, xDamping, or yDamping to 1 to keep velocity in that direction constant.


"scale"
Type: Number
Description: Physics-specific scale of the vent.
