CBGadgets Info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CBGadgets are tools for CBEffects. They're generally things that I don't feel CBEffects necessarily needs, but would still be cool to have. They're each independent modules (apart from dependency on CBEffects) and can be nested to oblivion if you wish.

Current List of CBGadgets:
	* Retroizer
	* MultiParam

Enjoy!
