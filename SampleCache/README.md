SampleCache Info
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The SampleCache is a set of sample codes for getting started with CBEffects.

These samples are for those who want a bit less to start out with - the sample app can be a bit overwhelming at first glance. These samples will be updated and added to as time goes on.


List of Samples:

BeginnerSamples - Simple for beginners
	BasicVent - How to create and start a Vent
	DoubleVent - Including more than one vent in a VentGroup
	LoadPreset - Loading a preset
	HelloWorld - Using build functions
	HelloWorldRandomized - Using build functions
	Ring - Use of posRadius and posInner
	TouchPoint - Adding basic interactivity to a Vent

Fields - Using Fields and FieldGroups
	BasicField - Linking up a Field with a Vent
	RepelField - Basic interactivity and Field presets
	AttractField - Basic interactivity and Field presets
	MultiField - Including more than one field in a FieldGroup

Physics - Adding physics behavior to VentGroups
	Angles - Using angle parameters
	Box2D - Adding Box2D physics to particles
	Gravity - Using the effect of gravity on particles

That's it for now, but I'll be adding new ones as time goes on.
