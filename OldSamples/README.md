CBEffects Old Samples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These are the old samples from previous versions of CBEffects. They are not going to be updated, but I'll include them just for the sake of doing it. Please note that they may not work if the version of CBEffects you are using doesn't support something they're doing.

Use them all by calling

require("SampleName")

On a (preferably) blank scene.
